# Panettone recipe
## What I did 🚀
I practice a bit of HTML5 and CSS3, recreating a Panettone´s recipe <br/>
What I did? <br7>
1-Created a HEADER with a TITLE and a NAVIGATION BAR. <br/>
2-Linked the buttons of the navigation bar with the sections of the page. <br/>
3- Created the sections: Ingredients, Praparation, Nutritional information and Utensils. <br/>
4- With CSs I added some styles and finally make responsive website.
